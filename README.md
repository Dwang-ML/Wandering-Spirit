# How to play
The buttons are self-explanatory, so I will mainly discuss the controls.
There are 3 controls (which matches the theme of the jam):
 - [left arrow / A] It boosts the player left and up
 - [right arrow / D] It boosts the player right and up
 - [up arrow / w] It dashes the player straight up. Holding will dash longer.

# How it satisfies the theme of this jam

## How it satisfies "3 buttons"
This game uses 3 buttons as controls for the player.

## How it's retro styled
Here are some criteria I came up with for a retro style game:

1. Graphics: Uses pixel art, 8-bit or 16-bit graphics reminiscent of early gaming consoles like the NES, SNES, or Sega Genesis. These visuals often have limited color palettes and blocky, simplistic designs.

2. Gameplay Mechanics: Simple yet challenging gameplay, often focused on core mechanics without complex narratives. Platformers, shoot-'em-ups, and arcade-style games are common examples.

3. Sound and Music: Chiptune or synthesized soundtracks that mirror the audio capabilities of older gaming hardware, giving a nostalgic feel.

4. Control Style: Basic control schemes, often with fewer buttons or inputs similar to the classic controllers of older consoles.

5. Theme and Story: Stories and settings that pay homage to classic games or replicate the adventurous, heroic, or sci-fi themes popular in older titles.

6. User Interface (UI): Simple, straightforward interfaces that mimic the aesthetics of older menus and HUDs (heads-up displays).

This game satisfies graphics since it uses pixel are, mostly 16 or 32 bit. The colors are limited as well, with mainly blue, orange, red and brown.

This game satisfies gameplay mechanics because it is simple to control the player, yet it can be very challenging, like the 5th level. It is focus on the core mechanics of player movement, where timed clicks are important.

This game satisfies sound and music because the music is chiptune-like.

This game satisfies control style because it has very few buttons (only 3, since it was the prerequisite of the jam).

This game does NOT satisfy theme and story, since there was not enough time to include the backstory.

This game satisfies UI because the UI is very self-explanatory and simple.
